CL-CDSI
===

This project is yet another attempt on my part to implement the clinical decision support
for immunizations system as described by the [Centers for Disease Control](https://cdc.gov) document 
[CDSi Logic Spec](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/programs/iis/interop-proj/downloads/logic-spec-acip-rec-4.3.pdf).
